## Part Two
- This repository is the working copy where I am working on implementing part 2 of this week's challenge.
- The requirements can be found at :: https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1743334/assignments/12845641?module_item_id=26321394

## My Implementation
My Part TWO implements:
- a collection of users, each with a user id
- each user can add multiple resumes
- each user can view their resumes
- it can handle input from multiple users during a given session
- you can switch between users
- you can add a new user
- it continues to implement the Part ONE specifications of AT LEAST ONE achievement, AT LEAST ONE work experience, and AT LEAST THREE skills.
- it formats each resume nicely and prints it out with a header that states "RESUME 1" or "RESUME 2" etc...

### Not yet implemented
My Part TWO does not include...
- the recruiter extension
- the ability to edit a user's resume's information (name, email, or phone number)
- it does not include phone number for the user's resume
- it does not allow for ZERO educational achievements, work experiences, or skills on a given resume.
